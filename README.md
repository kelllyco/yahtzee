## Yahtzee Simulator: Personal Project
### Functionality:

This simulator allows a player to build upon their Yahtzee skills by allowing the player to play an entire round of Yahtzee.
It bounds players to the classic rules. It also handles all category calculations, so players can focus on the game,
rather than arithmetic.


### Purpose:

The project is an attempt to replicate one of my family's favorite games, Yahtzee, in software.
My ultimate goal for this project has been do do everything correctly. For example, I've taken the time to go through each
of the core classes of the project and fully build them out while also keeping in mind future use cases.

I've also been using it to expand upon what I've learned in my classes, and I've been going back and changing things
as I learn ways to design them better. For example, one thing that I desperately need to fix once I have the time
is my searching algorithm for the full house scoring category.


### Future Plans

While I completed this project back in August, I've been returning to fix things up and add improvements as my schedule allows.
Below is a partial list of the things I've been working on adding/improving:
- Ability to play against a 2nd player
- Ability to play against a NPC (logic for this built with linear optimizaiton? train a simple ai?)
- Ability to run on Windows machines, rather than just Mac/Linux
- Adding a non-command line UI (probably with JS, but that's still up in the air)
- Clean up the algorithms behind my calculator functions
- Add instructions, examples, and test cases to Git for others to easily play


### Misc Background Info:

I began this project in early July, and I added it to a different repository at the end of the month. This project has been my
first attempt at using Git, and, while exploring how Git works, I made some mistakes that made it easier for me to just start scratch from a new repo. That's why my working history on this project is incomplete.
